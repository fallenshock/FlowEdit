## Installation
1. Clone the repository

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install torch diffusers transformers accelerate sentencepiece protobuf` <br>
	* New version of diffusers may have compatibility issues, try install `diffusers==0.30.1`
 	* Tested with CUDA version 12.4 and diffusers 0.30.0

## Running examples
Run editing with Stable Diffusion 3: `python run_script.py --exp_yaml SD3_exp.yaml`

Run editing with Flux: `python run_script.py --exp_yaml FLUX_exp.yaml`

## Usage - your own examples

* Upload images to `example_images` folder. 

* Create an edits file that specifies: (a) a path to the input image, (b) a source prompt, (c) target prompts, and (d) target codes. The target codes summarize the changes between the source and target prompts and will appear in the output filename. <br>
See `edits.yaml` for example.

* Create an experiment file containing the hyperparamaters needed for running FlowEdit, such as `n_max`, `n_min`. This file also includes the path to the `edits.yaml` file<br>
See `FLUX_exp.yaml` for FLUX usage example and `SD3_exp.yaml` for Stable Diffusion 3 usage example. <br>
For a detailed discussion on the impact of different hyperparameters and the values we used, please refer to our paper.

Run `python run_script.py --exp_yaml <path to your experiment yaml>`
